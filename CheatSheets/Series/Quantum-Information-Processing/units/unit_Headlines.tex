\begin{description}
\item[headline] popular understanding \beguilerResponse{corrective comment}
\item[it's both at the same time] the cat is not just alive or dead, but
  both at the same time \beguilerResponse{it is a
  \emph{superposition} of ``both'' states but can also be a superpostion of
``other'' states as well}
\item[spooky action at a distance] manipulation of one part of an entangled
  system influences the other part instantaneously no matter how distant
  they are from each other \beguilerResponse{they are a single system, one
    part does not \emph{act} on the other, and information transfer obeys
    the cosmic speed limit}
\item[delayed choice quantum eraser] \emph{after} measuring part $A$ of a
  system a choice is made in part $B$ that effects whether particle or wave
  observations appear in the first part \beguilerResponse{one part does not
    \emph{act} on the other (oh, we already said that) \ldots recognize
    that classical communication between the parts is necessary and that
    post-selection based on coincidence measurements reveals the particle
    or wave nature (but the original entanglement itself is still weird!)}
\item[teleportation] 
\item[many-worlds theory] implies an ever-burgeoning number of
  universes exist to accommodate all possible outcomes, including a
  universe where we do not continue to pursue quantum technology 
  \beguilerResponse{that just can't be right}
