  \begin{itemize}
  \item Isolation
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Generated quantum states are fragile
    \item Noise destroys, or at least complicates, their coherent nature
    \item Segregation from environment and other systems is paramount \ldots
    \end{itemize}

  \item Interaction
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \ldots except splendid isolation leaves no means for control
    \item Manipulation and detection of quantum states is necessary for
      utility
    \item Quantum systems need to influence one another and another
      and \ldots
    \end{itemize}

  \item Interconnection
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \ldots a completely other
    \item Collections of heterogeneous quantum systems must inter-communicate
      quantum information  
    \end{itemize}
