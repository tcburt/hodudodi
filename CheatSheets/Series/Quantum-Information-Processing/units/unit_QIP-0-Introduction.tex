(Caution: Brief descriptions of quantum mechanics, even with mathematics,
carry the easily-realized potential to be wrong. Don't carry the qualitative
narrative too deeply.)

\subsection*{Quantum Resources}
\begin{description}
\item[Measurement changes things]
\item[Superposition increases things] 
\item[Entanglement intertwingles thingles] \bcsmbh Wonderful, \bcquestion mysterious, and \bcdanger treacherous. 
\end{description}


\subsection*{Quantum Information Processing Triad}
\begin{description}
\item[Sensing] refined measurement, novel imaging
\item[Communication] provable (or at least enhanced) security, protected
  information exchange, detectable adversaries, key generation and distribution
\item[Computing] exponentially faster calculations, tractable simulation of
  physical systems
\end{description}
